# Election Key Terms
Heatmap visualizations of key terms in the Colorado, Virginia, and Florida midterm elections. Results from Google News

I began working on this project at BlueLabs where I am an intern. We wanted to begin by answering the following question: What were the key issues in some of the important races in the past midterm election (2014)>

I began with Colorado and Virginia, both very close races in battleground states.I also expanded this to include Florida. I am currently working on a more scientific method to analyze the key issues of the Florida gubernatorial race using some form of web scraping/text analysis for Google News results.

These following heatmaps shows the number of results returned for key terms on Google News related to the Colorado and Virginia 2014 senate races, as organized by each month leading up to election day on November 4.
